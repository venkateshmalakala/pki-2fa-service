# Secure PKI-Based 2FA Microservice

A production-ready, containerized microservice that implements Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). The system features enterprise-grade security practices including RSA 4096-bit asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, and persistent storage management.

## 🚀 Features

* *Asymmetric Cryptography:* Uses RSA 4096-bit keys for secure seed transmission.
* *Secure Decryption:* Implements RSA-OAEP with SHA-256 and MGF1 padding.
* *Standardized TOTP:* Generates 6-digit codes (RFC 6238) compatible with standard authenticator apps.
* *Dockerized Architecture:* Multi-stage Docker build with optimized image size.
* *Background Logging:* Integrated Cron job for auditing 2FA codes every minute.
* *Data Persistence:* Docker volumes ensure user seeds survive container restarts.
* *Time Synchronization:* Enforces UTC timezone for accurate TOTP generation.

## 📋 Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* Git installed.
* *Security Keys:*
    * student_private.pem: Your generated 4096-bit private key.
    * instructor_public.pem: The instructor's public key (for proof verification).
* *Encrypted Seed:* The encrypted_seed.txt file obtained from the instructor API.

## ⚙ Setup & Installation

1.  *Clone the Repository*
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/venkateshmalakala/pki-2fa-service
    cd pki-2fa-service
    

2.  *Verify Key Files*
    Ensure the following files are present in the project root:
    * student_private.pem
    * instructor_public.pem
    * encrypted_seed.txt

3.  *Build and Run with Docker*
    bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    

4.  *Verify Container Status*
    bash
    docker ps
    # Status should be 'Up' for pki-2fa-service

## 🔌 API Documentation

The service exposes the following REST endpoints on *Port 8080*.

### 1. Decrypt Seed
Decrypts the encrypted seed and stores it persistently.
* *Endpoint:* POST /decrypt-seed
* *Example Request:*
    bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/decrypt-seed \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"encrypted_seed\": \"$(cat encrypted_seed.txt)\"}"
    
* *Success Response:* {"status": "ok"}

### 2. Generate 2FA Code
Generates a current TOTP code based on the stored seed.
* *Endpoint:* GET /generate-2fa
* *Example Request:*
    bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/generate-2fa
    
* *Success Response:* {"code": "123456", "valid_for": 28}

### 3. Verify 2FA Code
Verifies a user-provided code with a tolerance of ±30 seconds (1 period).
* *Endpoint:* POST /verify-2fa
* *Example Request:*
    bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/verify-2fa \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"code": "123456"}'
    
* *Success Response:* {"valid": true}

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### 1. Cron Job Verification
The system runs a cron job every minute to log the current 2FA code. To verify this works (wait at least 1-2 minutes after starting):

```bash
# Note: Use double slash // for Git Bash on Windows
docker exec pki-2fa-service cat //cron/last_code.txt
