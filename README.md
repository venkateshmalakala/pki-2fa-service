# Secure PKI-Based 2FA Microservice

This project implements a secure, containerized microservice for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) two-factor authentication. It demonstrates enterprise-grade security practices using RSA 4096-bit encryption, digital signatures, and Docker.

## 🚀 Features
- *RSA-OAEP Decryption:* Securely receives and decrypts sensitive seeds.
- *TOTP Generation:* Generates RFC-compliant 2FA codes.
- *Dockerized:* Runs as a secure microservice with persistent volumes.
- *Cron Job:* Logs 2FA codes every minute for auditing (UTC timezone).
- *Security:* Keys are managed via PKI; strict validation on all inputs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Language:* Python 3.11
- *Framework:* FastAPI
- *Cryptography:* cryptography (RSA-PSS, RSA-OAEP), pyotp
- *DevOps:* Docker, Docker Compose, Linux Cron

## ⚙ Setup & Installation
